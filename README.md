## Plain Hack starter project for prismic.io

This is a blank plain Hack project that will connect to any prismic.io repository, and trivially list its documents. It uses the prismic.io Hack development kit, and provides a few helpers.

### Getting started

#### Launch the starter project

Fork this repository, then clone your fork, and set up your HipHop Virtual Machine.

If you haven't, [install Composer](https://getcomposer.org/doc/00-intro.md), and run `composer install`, to retrieve and install the Hack prismic.io kit and its dependencies.

Your plain Hack starter project is now up and running! However, by default, it will list and display documents from our "[Les Bonnes Choses](http://lesbonneschoses.prismic.me)" example repository.

#### Configure the starter project

Change the ```https://lesbonneschoses.prismic.io/api``` API endpoint in the `resources/config.php` file into your repository's endpoint.

To set up the OAuth configuration and interactive signin, go to the _Applications_ panel in your repository's settings, and create a new OAuth application. You simply have to fill in an application name and potentially the callback URL (`localhost` URLs are always authorized, so at development time you can omit to fill in the Callback URL field). After submitting, copy/paste the `clientId` & `clientSecret` tokens into the proper place in your configuration.

You may have to restart your Apache server.
